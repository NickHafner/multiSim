# TODO

Tasks (for entire summer): <br>

(1) Come up with a suitable file format<br>
    - TOML vs YAML vs ...<br>
    - The actual structure of the file (names of attributes, etc.)<br>
    - Should be "like" a scene graph<br>
    - (see the example below)<br>

(2) Generate code for simulating a scene<br>
    - We want to use ODE*, Bullet*, DART*, Project Chorno, MuCoJu, ...<br>
    - The different engines have different strengths and weaknesses<br>
    - I want to try them all at once<br>

Workflow:<br>
1. Write robot/scene in your format<br>
2. Generate code for different engines<br>
3. Simulate and compare<br>
<br>
